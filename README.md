### User Stories:

1. As a student I would like to see results for a particular field in Tawjihi only so that I will pick what is suitable for me from different choices of fields.
2. As a student I want the page to save my results so that I will be able to continue from where I left when I get back to the page.
3. As a principal I want to clear the results and show new results, so that I will be able to navigate between different fields results.
4. As a parent I want to have a reference for managing time of Tawjihi students so that my family can make decisions for activities during my son's Tawjihi.
5. As a user I want to be able to contact with web page designers so that feed back will be delivered to them.
